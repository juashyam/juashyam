## Hi, I'm Shyam ðŸ‘‹

My journey into programming started when a friend introduced me to C++, and I was instantly hooked.

From circuits to code, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how things work. I began with C++ and Java, tinkering my way through trials/errors before diving into the world of e-commerce and Magento.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve worked with top Magento partners, built solutions, and explored open-source projects. These days, Iâ€™m having fun experimenting with Rust. Welcome to my spaceâ€”letâ€™s geek out together! ðŸš€
