## Hi, I'm Shyam 👋

My journey into programming started when a friend introduced me to C++, and I was instantly hooked.

From circuits to code, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work. I began with C++ and Java, tinkering my way through trials/errors before diving into the world of e-commerce and Magento.

These days I'm experimenting with Python, Node.js, Rust, and whatever else catches my interest. Let’s geek out together! 🚀
